# V/F Controlled Induction Motor Drive using PWM & SVPWM (MATLAB/Simulink)

## Project Overview
This project models a **Variable Frequency Drive (VFD)** for a three-phase induction motor using MATLAB/Simulink.  
It implements **V/f control** and compares:

- Sinusoidal PWM (SPWM)  
- Space Vector PWM (SVPWM)

The simulation demonstrates how voltage is adjusted proportionally with frequency to control motor speed.

## PWM Modulation Subsystem

This subsystem generates:
- Frequency signal  
- Modulation index  
- 3-phase sine references  
- PWM/SVPWM switching pulses

## V/f Control Principle

\[
V \propto f
\]

When frequency decreases from **50 Hz → 10 Hz**,  
the inverter voltage also decreases proportionally.

This keeps motor flux constant and prevents saturation.

## SPWM vs SVPWM

| Feature | SPWM | SVPWM |
|--------|------|------|
Voltage utilization | Lower | Higher |
THD | Higher | Lower |
Efficiency | Moderate | Better |

SVPWM gives smoother output and better DC bus utilization.

## Output Filter Used

Series RL:
- R = 0.5 Ω  
- L = 0.1 mH  

Shunt C:
- C = 600 µF  

This reduces switching ripple.
